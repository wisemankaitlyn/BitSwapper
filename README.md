# BitSwapper
 
This is an experiment in getting a VHDL component and my VHDL environment up and running.  When it's finished, the component should just reverse the bits in the word it's sent, e.g.

0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1   ->   1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0

I'm using the [Avalon Interface Spec](https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/programmable/us/en/pdfs/literature/manual/mnl_avalon_spec.pdf) for the signals.
